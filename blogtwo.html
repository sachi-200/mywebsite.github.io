        <center><h1>MUSIC</h1></center>
        <h3>In the most general of terms, music is the arrangement of sound to create some combination of form, 
        harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive content. Definitions of music vary depending on 
        culture, though it is an aspect of all human societies and a cultural universal.<br/>
        While scholars agree that music is defined by a few specific elements, there is no consensus on 
        their precise definitions. The creation of music is commonly divided into musical composition, 
        musical improvisation, and musical performance, though the topic itself extends into academic 
        disciplines, criticism, philosophy, psychology, and therapeutic contexts.<br/> 
        Music may be performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human voice, 
        and thus is often credited for its extreme versatility and opportunity for creativity.<br/>
        In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some extent improvised. For instance,
        in Hindustani classical music, the performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined
        structure and using characteristic motifs.<br/> 
        In modal jazz, the performers may take turns leading and responding while sharing a changing 
        set of notes. In a free jazz context, there may be no structure whatsoever, with each performer 
        acting at their discretion.<br/> 
        Music may be deliberately composed to be unperformable or agglomerated electronically from many 
        performances. Music is played in public and private areas, highlighted at events such as festivals,
        rock concerts, and orchestra performances, and heard incidentally as part of a score or soundtrack 
        to a film, TV show, opera, or video game.<br/> 
        Musical playback is the primary function of an MP3 player or CD player, and a universal feature 
        of radios and smartphones. Music often plays a key role in social activities, religious rituals, 
        rite of passage ceremonies, celebrations, and cultural activities.<br/> 
        The music industry includes songwriters, performers, sound engineers, producers, tour organizers, 
        distributors of instruments, accessories, and sheet music. Compositions, performances, and recordings 
        are assessed and evaluated by music critics, music journalists, and music scholars, as well as amateurs.
